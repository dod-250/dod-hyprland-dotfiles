This theme was inspired by this artwork of my favorite band, and my love for catppuccin macchiato.

I made these dotfiles in two sections : desktop and laptop. Use the one that fit your usage.

I use the following :

 - Browser : Firefox
 - File Manager : Dolphin
 - Text Editor : Kate
 - Terminal : Kitty
 - Shell : Fish
 - Fetch : Fastfetch
 - Bar : Waybar
 - Menu : Wofi
 - Visualizer : Cava
 - Clock : Clocktemp https://github.com/arthur-dnts/ClockTemp
 - Matrix : Rs-matrix https://github.com/TitaniumBrain/rs-matrix
 - Music : Plexamp
